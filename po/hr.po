"<u>General</u>: These AI's are set up to simulate (to some extent) how these "
"animals  behave in real life.  This includes that they are animals, meaning "
"that they are not super smart.  As an example, the wolves generally hunt in "
"a pack, but are easily distracted by prey coming into range.  They are also "
"decent, but not great at cornering deer.  For the most part, this is "
"intentional.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Bears, Spiders and Yetis</u> mostly just wander in their respective parts "
"of the map.  They stay out of each other's way (and out of the way of the "
"dogs), but do attack each other if cornered.  They attack the other, weaker "
"animals (deer etc.) if those are within range.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Wolves</u> hunt in a pack.  They actively go after the closest deer (as "
"long as it stays in the forest) and try to corner it (not always super "
"successfully), but are easily distracted by other prey coming into range.  "
"The wolves try to avoid getting into the range of bears, spiders, dogs and "
"the yeti, except when they are going in for an attack.  If you let them move "
"for long enough, they will also learn that it is not healthy to attack the "
"tusklets.  When no deer is left, they wander randomly.  Note that, unlike "
"the Wolves Multipack AI (used in a different scenario), this Wolves AI "
"combines all wolves of the side in the same pack."

msgid ""
"Each <u>Deer</u> wanders randomly on forest tiles, except when enemies get "
"in its (the deer's) range, in which case it flees to the farthest point it "
"can reach.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Tuskers</u> exhibit the same behavior as deer, except when an enemy is "
"next to one of the tusklets.  This enemy will then experience the full wrath "
"of an irate boar.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Tusklets</u> blindly follow the closest adult tusker, except when there "
"is no tusker left, in which case they behave the same as deer.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Rabbits</u> also wander randomly, but in addition disappear into their "
"holes (if any are within reach) when enemies are close.  They reappear out "
"of their holes at the beginning of the turn, if it is safe.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Sheep dogs</u> try to keep their sheep safe.  This involves keeping them "
"inside the area outlined by the path the dogs have worn into the meadow, "
"positioning themselves in between the sheep and approaching enemies, and "
"attacking the enemies if those get too close.  You might have to let the "
"scenario play for quite some time before you get to see an interesting dog/"
"wolf interaction.  If no active herding or protecting move is needed, the "
"dogs go to a random location on the path.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Sheep</u> wander aimlessly except when a sheep dog is next to them, in "
"which case they run away from the dog.  The dogs exploit this by positioning "
"themselves on the outside of the sheep, if possible.  Sheep also run away "
"from approaching enemies.  The sheep, dogs and forest creatures (deer, "
"tuskers, rabbits) have learned that they are no threat to each other and "
"leave each other alone, demonstrating the enormous self control of a well "
"trained sheep dog."
